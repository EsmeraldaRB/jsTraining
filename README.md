# Repository's directives:

- Solve the excercises, I recommend using vs code.
- Proceed to push your changes using `git push --set-upstream origin master`.

# Exercises' directives:
- You will have to create a .js file for each exercise (as in 1.js provided example), take into consideration that:
  - Each file has to have the instructions for its exercise.
  - In order not to repeat the same declaration for the JSON file, import it on each js file (as in 1.js provided example).

# Keep in mind:
All variables, comments and functions must be declared in English and with names related to the exercise's purposes.
If you really get stuck with some exercise you can ask for help.

# That's it
Do your best, have fun!
